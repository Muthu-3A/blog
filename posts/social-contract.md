## Preface

This post explores the relationship between science and society. Of focus are the demands and tensions that shape it, the economic influences, and the resultant political structuring that attempts to regulate this contentious field for collective benefit.

It is structured academically and is likely too jargonistic for my intended audience. I hope to adopt a less formal approach in future blog posts so that those unfamiliar will profit from the discussion of epistemic ideas, which I believe are foundational and therefore important. My intention is to lead crucial discussions that are widely accessible and relevant to my audience.

Please engage with this post in the comments! I look forward to hearing critical feedback, what you learned or found interesting and what you want me to explore in future posts.

## Introduction

The complicated relationship between science and society, shaped by normative expectations, can be explored through the rich metaphorical framework of social contract theory where negotiations, implicitly if not overtly, are used to reconcile the agendas of autonomous parties in a mutually beneficial agreement (Maasen & Dickel, 2019).

The emergence of increasingly wicked problems such as sustainability science and the Coronavirus pandemic — characterized by uncertain facts, conflicting values and urgently high stakes — demand for a contemporary approach to this social contract through post-normal science (Waltner-Toews et al., 2020). For the knowledge produced by the scientific community to be effective, it must be ‘socially robust’ and seen by the public as transparent and participative (Sarewitz, 2016). Similarly, the scientific community must demonstrate relevance, accessibility and inclusion (Kukutai et al., al 2021).

The public has become increasingly aware of the prioritization of market interests over public welfare and therefore political reform in nation-states and institutional restructuring is necessary to prevent the disintegration of the relationship (Krishna, 2020). Various levels of scientific autonomy with regards to institutional power have been tried and a hybridized model seems to be the ideal solution. Such a task is not without its risks; research policy features volatile and diverse agents at multiple scales, which can make it difficult to define a shared sense of purpose and unclear the way to achieve it (Allen, 2023). Various tensions—personal time, clarity-complexity, speed-quality and supply-demand—necessitate dynamic trade-offs that must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis (Sarkki et al., 2014).

This annotated bibliography explores the challenges and dangers present in renegotiating the social contract between science and society. Through diligent re-engineering of research funding institutions and effective governmental policy, relevant parties can reach an updated and improved agreement.

## Annotations

### Arnott, J. C. (2019). Accelerating Actionable Sustainability Science Science Funding, Co-Production, and the Evolving Social Contract for Science. ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.

Arnott (2019) explores the co-production of scientific knowledge, examining whether public funding that promotes collaboration between scientists and societal users can enhance the production of actionable science. Through an analysis of coastal and estuarine research projects and a review of science funding programs in the United States and Europe, he proposes that while collaborative research funding fosters co-production, challenges remain in overcoming methodological barriers. His dissertation is highly relevant to ongoing efforts to make science more applicable and responsive to societal needs and contains new empirical data on the mechanisms and drivers of co-production in scientific research. It offers insights into how public funding can influence research practices and improve knowledge application. This contextual overview of the structures that propel scientific research is particularly relevant in the context of climate and sustainability, where long-term and foundational efforts by a multitude of parties are urgently needed in order to adapt to the rapid pace required for successful action. This dissertation is written for an academic audience, likely involved in the field of sustainability science and science policy. It employs accessible language and relevant figures; however, it is quite lengthy and highly specialized, therefore making it less useful for a general audience or those less familiar with science policy. Through the utilization of practical case studies and interviews with relevant parties, the author provides robust qualitative and quantitative data highly valuable to those seeking to deepen their understanding of the practical application of funding to increase co-production.

Krishna (2020) presents major challenges threatening the paradigm of open science and their implications. He examines the evolution of science as a social institution, positing that the relationship between science and society is founded on a scientific ethos characterized by universalism, communalism, disinterestedness and organized scepticism, which together facilitate systemic integrity. However, market-driven privatization, advanced technologies, and restrictions on data flow have emerged as significant challenges to the open science paradigm, which seek to distort priorities towards market interests rather than public welfare. The author raises concern as to the future state of the crucial science-society relationship, suggesting that successful solutions rely on institutional structures and nation-states that uphold the ethos of open science. This article is relevant for academics and policy makers but is especially pertinent for industry professionals in the business and innovation management sectors in order to understand recent developments in open science policy, where social responsibility and subsequent policy alignment with public good rather than corporate interests is of concern. The author’s critical analysis of financial incentives and privatization in science on a transnational scale is a crucial dimension in science-society relations. Acknowledging the tension between corporate and social interests outlines the political action necessary to manage this conflict for public interest. While the author’s initial historical contextualization at times seemed difficult to follow, the subsequent analysis of the challenges threatening the paradigm of open science is concisely and clearly presented. The article presents contemporary evidence, such as the inefficient response to the Coronavirus pandemic, to support the implementation of an open science policy as a remedy.

### Maasen, S., & Dickel, S. (2019). Normative answers - epistemic questions. Updating the science-society contract. In Handbook on Science and Public Policy (pp. 49–66). Edward Elgar Publishing. https://doi.org/10.4337/9781784715946.00011

Maasen and Dickel (2019) discuss the exceedingly complex and emerging relationship between science and society, expressing the need to renegotiate the current “science-society contract” in order to meet practical, external demands which the “epistemic core of science” has a historical tendency to neglect. The authors present an updated contract utilizing a threefold non-epistemic core which characterizes the systemic, social and temporal dimensions of knowledge co-production. These aspects are responsiveness, which decreases science’s self-referentiality and restricted stakeholder accountability; participation, which overcomes science’s operational blindness and narrow stakeholder input; and sustainability, which improves the science’s scope and brings to a greater consideration the consequences on all stakeholders affected both directly and indirectly. Acknowledging Citizen Science and Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) as an institutionalized microcosm for innovative practices embracing these normative orientations which utilize public involvement, the authors promote the internal incorporation of regulatory practice rather than externally imposing them. They acknowledge that, in order to reduce potential harm created by contracting the science-society relation, parties need to consider the dangers of an intellectual-reductionist mindset which trivializes complexities rather than outlining the uncomfortable political dynamics, and an elitist albeit traditional mindset of ‘expertise’ which can alienate the public from scientific communities. This chapter is written for social scientists, politicians and research institutions that want to deepen their understanding of the nuanced relationship between the scientific community and society. With theoretic rather than practical tendencies, this article is suited for long-term understanding and agenda rather than short-term applicative methodology. Because the chapter encourages the redistribution of responsibility from traditional institutions to a collaborative framework, readers would benefit greatly if the authors analysed how various stakeholders may understand the changes in their roles and responsibility. Furthermore, the chapter does not acknowledge significant barriers to meaningful participation and does not propose concrete strategies for mitigating proposed risks such as “epistemic drift” and technocracy. The authors lay out the historical development and shortcomings of previous social contracts, which is crucial context for understanding the impact and relevance of the proposed improvements.

The authors examine the impact of the Coronavirus pandemic on public trust in scientific expertise as it pertains to the medical field. The authors critique the limitations of traditional scientific approaches, advocating for post-normal science as a framework to address complex societal issues characterized by uncertainty and conflicting values. They argue that current models of expertise fail to provide guidance for fundamental issues of collective interest, the harms of which are made manifest in crisis, causing public hysteria and dissent. The authors emphasize the moral and political need for a new social contract that embraces diverse perspectives and promotes deliberative democracy, enabling communities to adapt and respond effectively to emerging challenges. The article is concise and clear with its language, conveying to medical experts the general trends and how it will shape their highly specialized industry, as well as the core political and social challenges and their subsequent remedies. It calls for a reformation of the top-down technocratic decision-making process based on numbers and models to one that acts as an extension of the “peer community”. Such a shift will draw attention away from concerns regarding an elitist cabal enforcing their agenda on society towards a scientific landscape supporting heterogeneous perspectives, which more accurately reflects the spectrum of views present in society. Since the article was only available in Italian, some of the intended phraseology may have been lost in translation. Despite this, the article offers a crucial analysis of contemporary developments in the rapidly developing relationship between science and society on a global scale.
