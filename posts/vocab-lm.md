How often are you writing or discussing something technical and you just can't seem to find the word that captures the nuance you want to convey? You know that it exists--you've sworn that you've used it before--but you just can't grasp it.

This was a problem I encountered enough to give some serious thought. Our functional vocabulary seems to envelop our receptive vocabulary in those areas that we are invested. Of course, we have a shared foundation in our fundamental and shared human experience, with different levels of refinement. We've all seen how the dog's tail wags and how the wind ruffles the leaves. Although there may be a world of linguistic, educational, cultural differences we are all fundamentally united in principle ways -- the sun rises and the rain falls on all of us.

When we love one another, we bridge these divides. True unity of mind, I would argue, is synonymous to to an equivalent understanding at the linguistic level which finds its fullness as it extends deeper into the human person. For example what is love? This a foundational question in this life. Some people might describe it on an emotional level, a passionate level. Others might describe it as a genuine care for those outside ourselves--treating your neighbor as yourself. Still others might extend it to self-sacrifice. The Christians say that God is love. The point I would like to convey is that linguistic meaning is malleable and it manifests itself being draws from something deeper.

We are bastions of antique tradition whether we realize it or not. See for yourself the beauty of etymology. One might ask if it is the words that shape our understanding or our understanding that shapes our words. I would argue both. The momentum of meaning is very strong and to some extent binding and the current collective cohort can leave their imprint. But this way of thinking is too conglomerate: there are numerous languages and schools of thought with various degrees of interaction.

Returning to our problem statement and model of functional-receptive vocabulary: we would like a tool to bridge this overlap.

Why not refer to a human knowledge base? We are fortunate to live in a time where we can quickly consult an online thesaurus. I'm sure a lot of us have tried this. Unfortunately, this proved to be much less effective than desired.

Thematically, some listed words were irrelevant as they refer to either different, unrelated meanings of a word (homonymy) or the meanings were related (polysemy) but weren't quite what I was looking for. The first problem with this knowledge base is with regards to matching suggestions with the fixed context in the rest of the sentence. The second problem, resulting from the first, is the quite shallow list of options especially considering outside of my immediate functional vocabulary. Due to the flexibility of language, in certain contexts words which otherwise wouldn't make sense (metaphorical) are not captured in this general-purpose knowledge base.

This more generally defined problem context is exactly the use case of large language models. In this blogpost we will design our own LLM for this specific use-case.
